# Zsh completions for apparix
Completions written for [apparix](https://micans.org/apparix/) with zsh. This is
basically just a replacement for `.bash_apparix`, so all you need to do is
install apparix as described at micans.org, place `.zsh_apparix` in `$HOME` (or
wherever else you fancy), and source it from your `.zshrc`.
